#### I am banned on steam community, so I can't do anything with my mods on steam. If you need any help or have a request, please write on discord or on github (even if you already requested in workshop comments because I currently have no means of communication on steam at all).

#### I might continue updating the mods on github but I will focus on what I personally want in my game because most people probably won't see this and therefore won't be aware of the updates.

## Description
Vanilla archotech is underwhelming especially if you have mods that add craftable bionics with higher than 150% efficiency, like prostheses+ (which I highly recommend). This mod buffs vanilla archotech to be 200% efficiency, and makes it more expensive to account for that. It adds new archotech bionics for all bodyparts, plus variations. There are currently 39 archotech bodyparts in this mod.

All new archotech bionics are acquired the same way vanilla archotech are acquired - from quests, traders or ancient dangers.

## Content
Common archotech. 200% efficiency and no additional stat boosts. Available for all body parts.
Special archotech. 200% efficiency and additional stat boost. There are multiply different types of special bionics for each body part with different stat boosts. Now when you find an archotech bodypart, it might gives you an unique stat boost advantage. Those are more rare than common archotech.
Advanced archotech. 300% efficiency for limbs and 400% for organs, and major stat boosts. Very rare and very expensive.
Transcendent bodyparts. Extremely powerful, extremely valuable and hard to acquire. To prevent getting them easily, they are very heavy and you will need a huge caravan if you manage to find them on a quest. I don't know if they will actually spawn, I've never seen one in my playthrough..

## Compatibility/Bugs
Supports Elite Bionics Framework
This mod doesn't produce any errors in log
Minor issue - if you have SOS2, you will have archotech parts from both this mod and SOS2. I currently don't know how to patch that, help would be appreciated

## Notes
This mod is purely XML
I don't think I will make 150% efficiency version because it would be time consuming to maintain two versions
I didn't test the stats extensively, so any balancing feedback would be helpful
