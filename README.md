### This mod is work in progress and untested. I might change defNames before I upload this on steam in august!

Adds 20+ new archotech bionics for all body parts and multiple variations of each archotech bodypart with different stat changes. Now when you find an archotech implant, it might give you a unique advantage.

All new archotech bionics are acquired the same way vanilla archotech are acquired - from quests, traders or ancient dangers.
