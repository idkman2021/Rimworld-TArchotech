### This mod is untested and WIP.

## Description
Adds archotech prostheses for all body parts and multiple variations of each archotech prosthesis with different stat changes. Now when you find an archotech implant, it might give you a unique advantage.

All new archotech bionics are acquired the same way vanilla archotech are acquired - from quests, traders or ancient dangers.
