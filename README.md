##### I am banned on steam community, so I can't do anything with my mods on steam. If you need any help or have a request, please write on discord or on github (even if you already requested in workshop comments because I currently have no means of communication on steam at all).
##### Please note that steam versions of the mods are outdated as I can't update them.


## Description
Adds archotech prostheses for all body parts and multiple variations of each archotech prosthesis with different stat changes. Now when you find an archotech implant, it might give you a unique advantage.

All new archotech bionics are acquired the same way vanilla archotech are acquired - from quests, traders or ancient dangers.
